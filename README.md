# Recipe Page (HTML)

["Project: Recipes"](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) from The Odin Project's Foundations course

## About
Recipes-Page-HTML is a beginner friendly project meant to help myslef get familiarized with HTML concepts such as tags, elements, and other components. However, the greatest takeaway from the project was learning how to build an HTML boilerplate and create a skeleton for future webpages/web layouts.

### Important Concepts
- HTML Structure/Boilerplate
- Elements and tags (`<p>`, `<h1>`, `<img>`, etc.)
- HTML lists (unordered `<ul>` and ordered `<ol>`)
- Links and anchor (`<a>`) tags
- Webpage photos/images (`<img>`)

### Accomplishments
Although my project is primarily supposed to be a skeleton to be build on later, I am still proud about the general layout! I liked using the different lists to display directions/ingredients and using images to display the recipe we're trying to make.

I am also proud to implement anchor elements to help with webpage navigation. Through this, I was able to learn how to structure certain webpages while still making an effort to provide a user friendly experience.

### Future Improvements
While making a brand new recipe page is not on my future scope, this project makes me consider the idea of posting them in a future blog as a way to overall have fun and add more personality to myself/my page.
